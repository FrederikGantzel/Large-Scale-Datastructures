# Large-Scale-Datastructures
Some assignments for INF-504 "Large Scale Datastructures", NAU Spring semester 2021. I enjoyed this course a lot, and I think I learned a great deal of coding from these exercises.

## Installation and Usage
Download the folder with all the programs in them. When you want to run one of the programs, set the directory to that program and type in "make" in the console to compile. The different programs have different ways of running them, so be sure to read the readme file for the specific program you want to run.

Some of the subproblems of the programs were designed to run on NAU's "Monsoon" computer cluster, and thus might be very slow if you try to run them with the same inputs as in the pdf writeups. Be sure to input small values when running these programs, or they might take forever to finish running.

Some examples:
