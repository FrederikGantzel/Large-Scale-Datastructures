No special modules are needed to run the program.

The program requires inputs of the following format:

	./homework Problem<subproblem> <number of random sequences (problems 1B and 2B) / number of random fragments from the COVID genome (problem 2C)>

For example, to run the programs answers for subproblem 1B, and make 10,000 random sequences, the inputs would be:

	./homework Problem1B 100000

The names for each of the subproblems are:
Problem1A
Problem1B
Problem2A
Problem2B
Problem2C
