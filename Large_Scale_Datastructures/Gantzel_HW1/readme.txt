the input to run the program is:

./homework problem1A sample_hw_dataset.fa

replace "sample_hw_dataset.fa" with another data set or another path if needed.

I could not for the life of me figure out how to run the program on monsoon
and thus, i've only run the program on my own labtop using the sample dataset.
also, questions A and B and D remain unanswered.

I also just realized that
"Solutions to sub-problems must be executable separately from each other.
For example, via a special flag passed as command line argument"
I have not implemented this, and thus, all answers are printed with a single run of the program
using the above mentioned input.
