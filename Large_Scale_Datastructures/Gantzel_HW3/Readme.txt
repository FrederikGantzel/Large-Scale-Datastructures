No special modules are needed to run the program.

The program requires inputs of the following format:

	./homework Problem<subproblem> <filepath to hw3_dataset.fa> <filepath to test_genome.fasta>

For example, to run the programs answers for subproblem 1B, the inputs would be:

	./homework Problem1B "/common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw3_dataset.fa" "/common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta"
	(assuming that those are indeed the correct filepaths)

The names for each of the subproblems are:
Problem1A
Problem1B
Problem2A
Problem2B
